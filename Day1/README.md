Day 1 of Code

Problem 1: swapString.py
We have 2 variables glass1 and glass2. glass1 contains milk and glass2 contains juice. Write 3 lines of code to switch the contents of the variables. You are not allowed to type the words "milk" or "juice". You are only allowed to use variables to solve this exercise.

Project 1: bandNameGenerator.py
Day 1 Project: Band Name Generator
Introduction to the Band Name Generator Project
In this final project, we will build a Band Name Generator program. The program asks the user for the city they grew up in and the name of their pet, then combines these inputs to create a band name.

You can check out the project by visiting the provided link or by navigating to the Course Resources page and clicking the corresponding link. The program's interface prompts the user for input and then displays the generated band name.

User Input and Cursor Formatting
Notice that when the input prompt appears, the cursor shows up on a new line. For example, when the program asks, "What's the name of the city you grew up in?", the cursor appears on the following line, providing a clean input interface.

Project Instructions
You are encouraged to complete this project by applying everything learned so far, including printing, input handling, variables, new lines, string manipulation, and debugging. Once completed, your program should function identically to the example provided.
